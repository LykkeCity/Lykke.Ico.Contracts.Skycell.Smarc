# Lykke.Ico.Contracts.Skycell.Smarc

## Development Process

We use [Truffle](http://truffleframework.com/docs/) for development and testing.

Install with ```npm install -g truffle```.

Launch develop network with ```truffle develop```.

Publish contract with ```migrate --reset```.

Test with ```test```.

See [documentation](http://truffleframework.com/docs/) for further scenarios.

## Libs

Please, consider copy/paste of common functionality to the single contract file.

In case of smart contracts, which contain rather small amount of code, this approach makes developing, reviewing and deploying processes easier and faster.
