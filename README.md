# Lykke.Ico.Contracts.Skycell.Smarc

## Development Process

We use Truffle for development and testing. See truffleframework.com/docs/ for details.

## Libs

Please, use copy/paste [to local files] instead of using NPM or EthPM or referencing remote files.

Also, use local files only for interface defenitions (like ERC20 or ERC677) or libraries (like SafeMath).
All logic, even common (like Ownable), should be written directly to contract file.

In case of smart contracts, which contain rather small amount of code, this approach makes developing and reviewing processes easier and faster.
